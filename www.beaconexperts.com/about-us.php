	<h1>About Beacon Associates </h1>
	<hr class="hrf1a916" />
	<div id="body_content">
		<div id="text-main">Beacon Associates was founded in 2004 as a family-owned business specializing in individual health insurance.  15 years experience coupled with our goal to assist our customers in finding the best healthcare coverage for their needs has become a combination our customers appreciate.  The advantage to working with Beacon is that we don't send you back out to sea after the sale! We are there to guide you with any additional help you may need with your policy.<br />
<br />In 2006 we were introduced to the AAWV (American Association for Wartime Veterans) and since then we've assisted over 1500 Veterans or their Surviving Spouses in obtaining the improved pension from the VA.

This enabled him to offer more carrier choices to his customers as well as other beneficial services.</p>
        <p>Now, as Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing for Atlantis Marketing Solutions and a Professional Member of the AAWV, Steven educates families of veterans and other Professional Members on The Improved Pension with Aid and Attendance Benefit.
