				<strong>Retirement Planning </strong>Retirement planning is essential to ensure you will have enough money to support your desired lifestyle once you retire.
			</div>
			<p>Lets pretend every asset you have is liquid, moveable, and changeable.  Next, ask yourself, if you could make a new plan starting today, what would it look like?  That includes your CD’s, money markets, annuities, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, REIT’s, or whatever.  So let's distinguish between your “investable” assets vs. assets that are not.  (i.e.  Rental Property or Real Estate)</p>
			<p>You have to imagine your assets not where they are invested today, or last year, or even where they were 10 years ago.  We’re not looking in the rear-view mirror, but trying to map out our future.</p>
